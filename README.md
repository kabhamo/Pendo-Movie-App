## What I learned
- It was my first time to work with Dart language and Flutter.
- 
- Flutter helped me to paint my app to life in milliseconds with Stateful Hot Reload,
- Quickly ship features with a focus on native end-user experiences with expressive and flexible designs.
- At the beginning I face some difficulties with the search button functionality, but like always, I make it work!.
- It was so exciting to learn the Dart Flutter SDK and these new technologies with Android Studio.
